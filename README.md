Lighthouse is a powerful command line interface tool designed to facilitate the interaction with Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the SEI blockchain. It allows users to easily update and deploy NFT collections.

## Features

- Deploy NFT collections with royalty option
- Update NFT collections
- Freeze/Unfreeze trading of NFT collections
- Reveal metadata of NFT collections
- View NFT collections
- Mint NFTs
- Generate merkle root for allowlists
- Generate merkle proof for a wallet
- Upload metadata and image files to upload to arweave


## Installion

From your command line:
```bash
# Install lighthouse globally
$ npm install -g @we-bump/lighthouse-cli

# Run the app
$ lighthouse

```
--count
```

### `validate`

Validate metadata and image files to upload to arweave. `(metadata files must be in ./assets folder)`

```
##### options
Path to Arweave wallet
```sh
--wallet <wallet>
```
Arweave node url `optional` `(default https://arweave.net)`
```
--url <url>
```

## Configuration

Lighthouse relies on a `config.json` file for configuration of NFT collections. If the file does not exist, the CLI will automatically guide you through creating a default one.

`iterated_uri` - should disable token_uri generate for iterated urls or not (eg: {token_uri}/1, {token_uri}/2, ...) 
(if set to true every nft will have same metadata url and if set to false every nft will have different metadata url)

`frozen` - should the trading be frozen or not (default: false) (can only freezed while deploying and can't be freezed after deployed) 

`hidden_metadata` - should the metadata be hidden and replaced with "placeholder_token_uri" or not (default: false) (can only be hidden while deploying and can't be hidden after deployed)

`groups` - array of mint groups

##### group options

`name` - group name

### Note

While minting, minters have to pay 1.5 $SEI for Lighthouse platform fee on every minted nft. (if mint is free, no fee will be charged)
